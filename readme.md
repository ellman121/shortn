# Shortnr - Python FastAPI built url shortener

## Notes

I've never used FastAPI before and I'm not a python professional, so expect some things to be non-conventional.

### File Structure

- `main.py` includes all the routes
- `classes.py` includes shared classes
- `url_shortener.py` includes implmentations for all routes
- `short_url_store.py` is the database implementation/abstraction layer
